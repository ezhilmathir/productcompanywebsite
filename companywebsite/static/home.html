            A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, 
            sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone 
            that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving
            within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection 
            to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the 
            public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone 
            services use a cellular network architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are
            called cellular telephones or cell phones in North America.
            <br />
            In addition to telephony, 
            digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, 
            MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), 
            business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only
             those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced
             computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.
